# User Experience Milestone Project
The purpose of this website is to attract people to visit the Imagine Leisure Centre and enjoy its services. The website highlights the features of the Leisure Centre.

## UX
The mobile-first approach design was implemented on this website to maintain the user experience from mobile devices to desktop computers. 

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://faithy80.github.io/ucfd-project/).

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)
4. Font Awesome (5.11.2)
5. Hover.CSS (2.3.1)

## Features
The following features were implemented:
* Jumbotron from Bootstrap 4, [See here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/jumbotron/)
* Blockquotes from Bootstrap 4, [See here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/typography/#blockquotes)
* Card from Bootstrap 4, [See here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/card/)
* Media object from Bootstrap 4, [See here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/media-object/)
* Tables from Bootstrap 4, [See here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/tables/)
* Modal from Bootstrap 4, [See here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/modal/)
* Navbar from Bootstrap 4, [See here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/)
* Clock and social media icons from Fontawesome.com, [See here](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free)
* Navbar item shadow from Hover.CSS, [See here](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)

## Testing
This site was manually tested in several web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Internet browser of my Samsung 4K television and Chrome developer mode) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. The Safari browser is outdated on windows. It cannot open the website. The link of every social icon has the `target="_blank"` attribute to open the social site in a new tab. The button for the modals (register and sign in) remains focused after clicked, leaving a blue outline around the button. As it turned out, it is a browser problem. However the outline can be removed, I found an article [here](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/react-bootstrap/issues/1300) and [here](http://outlinenone.com/) that advised not to remove it.

## Deployment
This site is deployed to Github pages. It updates automatically on a new commit to the repository. It can be cloned using `git clone https://github.com/faithy80/ucfd-project.git` in Command Line Interface or it can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/faithy80/ucfd-project) to run the site locally. After downloading, double click on `index.html` or launch it from a web browser to start the home page of the website.
